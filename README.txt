#BRINGING FRONTEND OR HTML TEMPLATES INTO THE PROJECT
Creat a templates directory in the app you want eg here we have done under customers and call it templates .
Creat an index file inside the templates dir
If you want dammy words use lorem number of words then tab, eg lorem69 then tab
Next creat a url, by making a view, then create a urls.py file under the app .....you should have urls file in the main project and the apps level

#Adding Stylesheets
create a static directory under the name of the project - do not forget to register it in the settings file here STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / 'static',
]
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'

It will host all stylings
add a style sheet under style
now when connecting the html files to the style, creat link tags in the html files  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../static/style/style.css">

the dots help us move out of the directory then go to the static directory and locate the style.css

adding bootstrap
by pasting it to the style file then add the following links to the index file to check for css and js
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../static/style/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../static/style/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js">

add a navbar in the index, by going to boostrap and selecting code for any nav bar


ginger templating
helps not repeat eg doing a navbar in each page eg home etc, we can reuse it repeatatively
using {% load static %}
if you do this to one file then delete all content in the other pages so we have one html file and then do all other thing there
now lets creat a html base file
now we will have content only in the base file all the other files/pages should be empty

in the base fle we will put all things that are repeated each time and do not change from page to page .
the unique content of each file are kept here
{% block content %}

all the unique things should be implemented here

{% endblock %}




#nov 07
making our nav bar links work
